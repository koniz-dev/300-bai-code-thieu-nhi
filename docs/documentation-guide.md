# Documentation Guide

## README.md Structure
- Problem description and examples
- All solution approaches with complexity analysis
- Key C++ concepts used in the solution
- Related problems and practice tips
- Code examples and explanations

## Documentation Organization
- **primitive-types.md**: int, long, double, char, bool, etc.
- **containers.md**: vector, map, unordered_map, set, unordered_set, etc.
- **algorithms.md**: sorting, searching, two pointers, sliding window, etc.
- **data-structures.md**: stack, queue, heap, tree, graph, etc.
- **cpp-features.md**: references, pointers, const correctness, etc.

## Content Guidelines
- Include practical examples and usage patterns
- Cross-reference between related concepts
- Add new C++ concepts when they appear in solutions
- Provide clear explanations with code snippets
- Organize information by categories

## Update Process
- Check if knowledge points already exist before adding
- Include practical examples from actual problems
- Maintain consistency across all documentation files
- Add cross-references to related concepts
